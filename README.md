# Treat Your Shelf API

Treat Your Shelf is a book sharing app designed to encourage and assist reading & sharing amongst people from all walks of life without needing to pay a penny.

Treat Your Shelf allows users to scan & upload their books onto a virtual bookshelf which can be viewed by other users who may wish to request a book swap! Users can search for desired books using the search function and request a swap or simply view another user's bookshelf to do the same!
